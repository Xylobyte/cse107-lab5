# CSE107 - Lab 5

This lab builds on the idea of manipulating lists and nested lists.

## Purpose

### cipher.py

This program takes a string as an input and returns a reversed string of it.

### luhns.py

This program uses luhns algorithm to validate a string to see if it is a 
valid credit card number.

### fractions.py

This program applies many functions to "fractions" in the form of tuples.

## Conclusion

* In this lab I practiced manipulating strings and fractions as well as 
  changing variable types to solve the given problems.
* Pair programming aided in giving me an outside look at my code
  and allowed me to ask questions and give help to my partner when
  it was needed.
* I did not work with my buddy on the lab.
* I not have any major problems while working on this lab aside from minor
  syntax errors which were easily fixed.
* I think I could improve my programs next time by compressing some functions
  even more than they already are.
